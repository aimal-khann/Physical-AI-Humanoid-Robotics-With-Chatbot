Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," a comprehensive Docusaurus textbook designed for higher education students. This book delves into the fascinating convergence of artificial intelligence with robotic systems, offering practical insights and code examples across key modules.

## Modules

Navigate through the core modules of the textbook:

*   [**Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**](01-ros2) - Explore the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System 2, focusing on nodes, topics, services, and `rclpy` for control.
*   [**Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**](02-gazebo-unity) - Dive into simulation environments, learning about physics, sensors (LiDAR, depth, IMU), and human-robot interaction in Unity.
*   [**Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**](03-isaac) - Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS VSLAM, and `Nav2` for humanoid path planning.
*   [**Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**](04-vla) - Discover how voice commands (`Whisper`) and large language models (LLM) translate into robotic actions.
*   [**Module 5: Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid**](05-capstone) - Integrate concepts into an end-to-end autonomous humanoid system, covering voice, planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation.
*   [**Module 6: References, Glossary & Further Reading**](06-references) - A curated list of resources, key terms, and suggestions for advanced study.

## About the Book

"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" is crafted to provide a professional, structured, and student-focused learning experience. Each chapter includes detailed explanations, runnable code examples, and practical exercises to reinforce understanding. We emphasize hands-on learning, encouraging students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world (simulated) robotic challenges.

### Audience

This textbook is ideal for higher education students keen on mastering Physical AI, ROS 2, robotic simulation, and humanoid robotics. Whether you're an aspiring robotics engineer, an AI researcher, or a student looking to bridge the gap between AI theory and robotic application, this book offers the foundational knowledge and practical skills you need.

### Tone

Professional, structured, student-focused, with clear explanations and comprehensive code examples.

### Non-Goals

*   **No Real-World Robot Hardware Guides Beyond Basics**: While the concepts are applicable to physical robots, this textbook focuses primarily on simulated environments and software-level implementations.
*   **No 3D Assets (Placeholders Only)**: The book uses placeholders for visual assets to maintain focus on the core technical concepts and avoid dependencies on complex 3D modeling.
